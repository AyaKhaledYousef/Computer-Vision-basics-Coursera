# Week Four: Mathematics for Computer Vision

- Computer Vision is used to solve vital problems in a vast array of fields including medical imaging, surveillance, face and object detection and identification. The techniques that linear algebra provides for solving complicated mathematical models are essential to solve problems in each of these fields.

**Calculus has two major branches:** 


1- Differential calculus - concerning instantaneous rates of change and slopes of curves

2- Integral calculus - concerned with the theory and applications of integrals. It deals with total size or value, such as lengths, areas, and volumes.


- Computer Vision uses derivatives, integrals and partial differential equations extensively in several low and mid-level vision tasks.
