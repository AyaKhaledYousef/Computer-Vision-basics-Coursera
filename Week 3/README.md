# Week Three: Low, Mid, & High-Level Vision

Three levels in David Marr’s paradigm:

1.      Computational theory – describes what the device is supposed to do

2.      Representation and algorithm – addresses precisely how the computation may be carried out

3.      Implementation – includes physical realization of the algorithm, programs, and hardware


- **Low-level vision** constitutes of image processing techniques, feature detection, image matching, and early segmentation.

- **Mid-level vision** is where things start to come together attributing meaning.

- **High-level vision** tasks are the algorithms which make sense of the visual content and make computer vision live up to the capabilities of human vision.
